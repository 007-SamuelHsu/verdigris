This library can be used to create QObject with signals and slots or properties without the need of moc.
It works by using different macro to declare the signals and slot.

Tested with Qt 5.6 but should work with earlier version of Qt 5
Requires a C++14 capable compiler.

For the documentation, see the tutorial.
